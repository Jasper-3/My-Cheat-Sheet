What's a good investment for 2023?
This might sound unconventional, but I’d go with blue-chip art.

A Basquiat painting soared 2,209,900% when it was bought for $5,000 and sold for $110,500,000 in 2017.

Obviously, you’ll probably never see results like that again, but these numbers still show that art can be a powerful financial asset.

Also if you can find gains like that anywhere else let me know, because I’d like to see it.

And here’s more reasons why blue-chip art is a solid option for 2023:

It has the lowest correlation to equities of any major asset class according to Citi. This means if the market dips, this asset doesn’t necessarily go down with it.
Contemporary Art prices outpaced the S&P 500 by twofold since 1995, but still isn’t as well-known as stocks.
WSJ is calling this “one of the hottest markets on Earth” because art transaction volume is at an all-time high.
In fact, Microsoft co-founder, Paul Allen, just sold his art collection at auction for $1.6 billion — beating the record for the most expensive collection ever auctioned.

One of the only major roadblocks to this asset class is that only the wealthy can afford it.

Normal investors just don’t have $1 million lying around to buy a Picasso.

But this changed in 2012 with changing regulations. It created increased flexibility for real assets like paintings to be securitized and allows everyday investors to invest in those shares.

And a company called Masterworks has built the largest securitized art investing platform.

So now investors can invest in famous artworks by the likes of Picasso, Banksy, and Basquiat.

They’ve handed members +21%, +27%, and +32% net returns from some of their past offerings.

*“Net returns” refers to the annualized internal rate of return net of all fees and costs, calculated from the offering closing date to the date the sale is consummated. IRR may not be indicative of Masterworks paintings not yet sold and past performance is not indicative of future results. See important Reg A disclosures: Masterworks.com/cd

I think shared hosting is a good place to start deploying your Laravel application but definitely is not the best. It is better to have your application in a cloud hosting provider such as Digital Ocean, Vultr, Cloudways, or Contabo if you are on a tight budget and scale from there.
